The next step for our project is to contact more institutions who want to cooperate with us.
Functionalitywise we thought about extending the user journey by providing audio walks, so that the POIs can be experienced as contiguous route.
Furthermore we wanted to give those institutions more template options for the information provided from them for a POI. This provides more variety when discovering the pois.
We also discussed the opportunities to include gamification in our app. Our main result was to let the user gather points by visiting POIs and combine that with possibility to donate the worth of the points to the institution which provided the information.
